# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles configuration. This repo serves more as backup
and version control purpose. Files lack comments to make it readable and
understandable to new users. More than just dotfiles it also serve my brewfiles
and maintenance of and tools such as brew, npm, pip, rvm.

Symlink is handled with a script I wrote manually, it is very not dry. All the
files here are linked on my dropbox therefore I have not found a reason to use
dotfile management tools yet.

Almost everything here are stolen from various other amazing people.

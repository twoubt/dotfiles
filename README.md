# dotfiles

To install
``` clone the repo into your directory ```
run
``` ruby install.rb ```
The script will move your existing dotfiles into a folder called old_dotfiles in
your home directory.

My recommendation is not to use install but rather browse through the dotfiles
and steal what you want. Slowly but surely you will build an awesome dotfile
collection too.

Almost everything here are stolen from various other amazing repos.

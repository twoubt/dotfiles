# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles and the configuration that it uses. It also has a
brewfile script so I can set up all the necessary brew components I need. It has
a clean up script to make the weekly maintenance simpler. There is a symlink
script to link all the dotfiles to the necessary places. 

type ```sh [scriptname]``` to run the script
